<p>In sixth century Greece there was a small town 133 miles away from athens called Sparta.
 It quickly grew to become the most dominant military force in greece. They are well known for creating 
the best greek warrior ever in history called the Spartans. These men were the best trained warriors in ancient Greece. They were well known and feared both in greece and in europe. They were well  known for their skills in combat and militant upbringing. </p>
from age seven young males in sparta were taken from their families to the trained in the Agoge and to become soldiers. Females also received some military training but never saw active combat.
They are especially famous for the greek persian war when Darius I the king of persian empire (iran in modern day) attempted to invade Greece.
Due to the spartan and greek resistance the persians failed to invade Greece. However in 480 BC the persians under Xerxes attempted to invade Greece a second time. But sent his emmiseries to Athens and sparta offering them "earth and water" to submit to Xerxes`s will both spartan and athenians killed the emmiseries and Xerxes then invaded Greece by force.
The oracle told King leonidas I of sparta that all of greece would fall to Xerxes. </p> Spartan law prevented Leonidas from mobilising sparta`s armies to fight Xerxes so he gathered his 300 spartans bodyguards along with 7,000 greeks to meet them at a pass in Thermopylae Which connects to the greek mainland.
 The spartans held the path for three days due to their phalanx formation and were inflicting high casulties to the persians 20,000  were killed by the spartans in reality. Leonidas sent the bulk of his army home where he and his bodyguards would stay and hold the pass.</p> Outnumbered three to one Leonidas and his 300 spartans were wiped out when a greek farmer called Ephialtes revealed to the persians that there was a pass behind the mountains that they could use to flank the spartans.
Although this was a huge loss to all of greece the greek states were encouraged by leonidas`s sacrifice and all of greece unified with one another to push the persians out of greece. which lasted for thirty years. 
This conflict costed the greeks about a year with huge casulties both sides. </p>The spartans won a ground battle at plataea and the athenians won the naval  battle of Salamais these battles were critical for a Greek victory. With these defeats Xerxes never invaded Greece again.
many movies were created to honour the spartans sacrifice such as the 300 staring Gerard Butler.

With the greeks victorious there remained another issue was created. Athens the capital city of greece and the birth place of democracy was in a dispute with sparta. 
Both sides disputed on how to rule greece which led to the Peloponnesian War as sparta and her allies as the Peloponnesian league.
 And athens and her allies as the delian league. Eventually the spartans emerged victorious due to the occupation of athens.</p>

<h2> chapter 2: The Roman republic and Rise of Gaius julus ceasar</h2>

<p> The Roman republic was built on the foundation of democracy in 753 BC
It`s founder and ruler was romulus but as democracy was the birth of the republic the senate were actually the rulers.
Despite its democratic system only the rich and powerful could vote corruption and bribery was running rampant in the senate and rome.
The republic expanded across the Italian penisula slowing reaching Africa and the middle east.
there was a civil war in the republic where the senate emerged victorious this civil war ignited the rise of julius caesar who would become the greatest roman general and the architecht of the roman empire.</p>

<h2>Julius ceasar</h2>
Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family, and was determined to restore his family`s reputation as they sided in the losing side of the civil war.
He joined the roman army at aged 16 and slowly moved up the ranks. In his 20s and 30s he became a politician and was elected in almost every office in roman government.
In 60 BC he ran for consul the head of the senate and was in a political debate with two other men.
The first was gaius marcus crassus a roman general who ceasar served in his legion who gained his trust after ceasar created a new tactic to crush the spartacus slave rebellion and the richest man in rome and the second Gaius Pompeius Magnus  who was the supreme commander of the roman army.
Both men were political and military enemies and many were afraid of a civil war due to both men not getting what they wanted.</p>
Caesar used this to his advantage he called for a meeting with both men and called for a truce and a political alliance  called the the First Triumvirate. Pompey was not willing to co operate at first so in order to gain his trust caesar gave pompey julia his daughter`s hand in marriage.
Now with the most powerful men on his side ceasar became consul But he was in debt with crassus and needed to get rid of the debt by any means. So he massed up four legions to invade Gaul (france) not only to absolve his debt but improve his reputation in the army.
After serveral years in gaul fighting the tribes he eventually emerged victorious but crassus was jealous of his miltary expedition and invaded parthia which became a huge faliure 20,000 romans dead crassus himself was killed.
Pompey used crassus`s death and ceasar`s absence to his advantage to become consul and his first act was to arrest ceasar as he illegally invaded Gaul.
caesar got wind of this and refused to be arrsted and instead crossed the Rubicon which started a civil war Pompey evacuated from rome with the senate (one famous member of the senate that alled with pompey  was brutus (who ceasar saw as his son) to Greece to meet his legions to fight ceasar.
Ceasar chased Pompey but failed to capture him as pompey had a 200 mile head start and escaped to Greece.</p>  Months later Ceasar built ships that could take half of his army to fight pompey but was not enough.
Pompey attempted to parley with ceasar but ceasar refused as pompey refused to drop the charges. Eventually marc antony roman general and ceasar`s second in command arrived with the rest of ceasar`s army
now ceasar could fight pompey and did at The Battle of Pharsalus in which cesar emerged victorious.
Pompey retreated again this time to africa where he created his military reputation he went to Egypt personally to visit Ptolomy XIII to get his support to fight ceasar but ptolomy refused. Instead he killed pompey and delivered his head to ceasar when he arrived in Egypt as well to get ptolomy`s support. Ceasar was horrified by the fact that pompey who was his son in law was brutally murdered which he did not want and refused to support Ptolomy and he had ceasar under house arrest.</p>

<h2>Ceasar`s new ally</h2>
<p>Despite being under house arrest for weeks ceasar attracted the attention of the former monarch now in exile of Egypt cleopatra herself. She freed ceasar and in return he allied with her to get ptolomey of the throne.
With the combined might of cleopatra and ceasar`s armies the quickly defeated ptolomey`s forces in Alexandria at the battle of the nile Ptolomey himself died in battle. He was pulled down by the weight of his armour and drowned in the nile.
Now with Egypt in cleopatra`s hands due to the aid of ceasar they quickly became from political allies to lovers. Back in rome it  was full of  chaos anarchy and crime due to pompey and the senate evacuating the city. Before leaving for africa Ceasar left marc antony to be in command to rome but he used brutal tactics to restore law and order to rome much to ceasar`s horror. Ceasar returned from egypt and assumed full command of the republic and the senate as dictator.</p>

<h2>Ceasar`s downfall</h2>
<p>Now the most powerful man in rome ceasar named himself dicator of the republic for life. His first acts were that he created a new grain distribution system to feed the population, built stadiums for gladiators to fight, reformed the roman army,providing romans jobs by creating a construction programme, built libaries and temples and passed a law giving citizens of gaul roman citizenship. 
However cleopatra arrived to Rome to give ceasar news that will change his status in the roman government she gave birth to his son ceasarion. With change of events, the senate saw this as a threat as they thought that ceasar has a heir that could take control of rome after ceasar and were were talking behind the scenes what to do.
Afterwards ceasar had a session with the senate and collapsed into a fit. It was revealed that he was diagnosed with epilepsy for many years of his life now the senate saw this as a weakness to exploit.</p>After recovering from his epilepsy fit ceasar had to restore his reputation he wanted to conqour more land for the republic and then created a plan to invade parthia that crassus failed to do so. He announced his plans to brutus who alerted his allies in the senate they did not have the funds to finance such a large scale invasion and then realised that they have to get rid of ceasar if he fails to conquer parthia and leads Rome to destruction also to them he was a thteat to their democracy.
Ceasar called a meeting with the senate to annouce his plans to parthia in pompey`s theatre there they striked they stabbed ceasar 23 times but it was Brutus that landed the killing blow.
his death was the birth of the roman empire. Brutus and the conspirators believed that if they killed ceasar they would have saved Rome but in reality they under estimated ceasar`s popularity with the population.
when news got out of his assassination people revolted which resulted in most of the conspirators including Brutus committing suicide. Cleopatra fled to Egypt with cesarion and married marc antony.

<h2>Roman empire</h2>
<P>Before his death ceasar named his great nephew octavian his heir and he formed the second Triumvirate with marc antony and marcus lepidus becoming dictators over the new roman empire but lepidus was sent into exile and antony was married to cleopatra and fellout with octavian which started another civil war with octavian victorious.
the empire expanded across europe north africa and in the middle east it had to be split in two empires western and eastern.
One reason for the roman empire downfall was that they made too many enemies especially in europe with germanic romanian french and british tribes which were called barbarians.
The barbarians sacked Rome and eventually the eastern empire fell. The eastern empire`s downfall was the birth of the byzantine empire.


<h2>The mongol empire</h2>
<p>The mongol empire was the largest empire ever on earth it was twice as large as the Roman empire. Its empire expanded all the way from Mongolia to china to persia to palestine to Germany.
The empire began by the birth of a man called temujin whose prophecy was to rule the world. Growing up in a mongolian tribe he and his family was excommunicated from his family tribe after his father was poisoned by a rival tribe. Temujin and his family were forced to ive of scraps and small provisions.His mother taught him about Mongol politics and tagught him the importance of unification and strong alliances.
He began his rise to power by ffering himself as an ally  to his father's anda (blood brother) Toghrul, who was Khan of the Keraites. This relationship was first reinforced when Börte was kidnapped by Merkits in around 1184. To win her back, Temüjin called on the support of Toghrul, who offered 20,000 of his Keraite warriors and suggested that Temüjin involve his childhood friend Jamukha, who was Khan of his own tribe, the Jadaran. 
Both temujim and Jamukha began consolidating power for themselves  and they became political and military rivals. Jamukha supported the traditional Mongolian aristocracy, while Temüjin followed a meritocratic method, and attracted a broader range and lower class of followers. Following his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the shaman Kokochu that the Eternal Blue Sky had set aside the world for Temüjin, Temüjin began rising to power. In 1186, Temüjin was elected khan of the Mongols. Threatened by this rise, Jamukha attacked Temujin in 1187 with an army of 30,000 troops. Temüjin gathered his followers to defend against the attack, but was decisively beaten in the Battle of Dalan Balzhut. Temujin began a life of seclusion for the next ten years</p>

<h2> Temujin`s return</h2>
<p> Around the year 1197 round the year 1197, the Jin initiated an attack against their formal vassal, the Tatars, with help from the Keraites and Mongols. Temüjin commanded part of this attack, and after victory, he and Toghrul were restored by the Jin to positions of power.The Jin bestowed Toghrul with the honorable title of Ong Khan, and Temüjin with a lesser title of j'aut quri.
Around 1200, the main rivals of the Mongol confederation  were the Naimans to the west, the Merkits to the north, the Tanguts to the south, and the Jin to the east. Jurchen inscription  in Mongolia relating to Temüjin's alliance with the Jin against the Tatars.
In his rule and his conquest of rival tribes, Temüjin broke with Mongol tradition in a few crucial ways. He delegated authority based on merit and loyalty, rather than family ties. As an incentive for absolute obedience and the Yassa code of law, Temüjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future war spoils. When he defeated rival tribes, he did not drive away their soldiers and abandon their civilians. Instead, he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe. He would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe, bringing them into his family. These political innovations inspired great loyalty among the conquered people, making Temüjin stronger with each victory.
Temujin defeated Jamukha at the battle of thirteen sides and Jamukha`s generals surrendered themselves and jamukha to temujin hoping to get an reward temujin had them executed and gave jamukha an opportunity to join him again but he wanted to be executed. So he had his back broken.
All the mongol tribes all united and swore loyalty to temujin and named him Genghis khan or the great Khan.</p>

<h2> Mongol invasion of china</h2>
<p> Genghis`s first military expedition was to invade china who was the richest nation in asia at that time he knew he had to hurry as he knew the chinese would not accept mongolia to be a powerful nation so close to them.
The chinese recruited mercenaries to fight the mongols but instead they allied with genghis khan.</p> Genghis mainly conducted small raids and skirmishes during his campaign but in 1209 Genghis undertook a larger campaign to secure the submission of Western Xia. After defeating a force led by Kao Liang-Hui outside Wuhai, Genghis captured the city and pushed up along the Yellow River, defeated several cities, and besieged the capital, Yinchuan, which held a well-fortified garrison of 150,000. The Mongols, at this point were  inexperienced at siege warfare, attempted to flood out the city by diverting the Yellow River. Chinese engineers who defected to the mongols showed them blueprints to siege weapons and machines such as the catapult which proved useful in the mongol`s future campaigns. But the dike they built to accomplish this broke and flooded the Mongol camp. Nevertheless, Emperor Li Anquan, still threatened by the Mongols and receiving no relief from the Jin dynasty, surrendered to the Mongol and demonstrated his loyalty by giving a daughter, Chaka, in marriage to Genghis and paying a tribute of camels, falcons, and textiles.[9]
After their defeat in 1210, Western Xia served as faithful vassals to the Mongol Empire for almost a decade, aiding the Mongols in their war against the Jin dynasty. In 1219, Genghis Khan launched his campaign against the Khwarazmian dynasty in Central Asia, and requested military aid from Western Xia. However, the emperor and his military commander Asha refused to take part in the campaign, stating that if Genghis had too few troops to attack Khwarazm, then he had no claim to supreme power. Infuriated, Genghis swore vengeance and left to invade Khwarazm, while Western Xia attempted alliances with the Jin and Song dynasties against the Mongols.
After defeating Khwarazm in 1221, Genghis prepared his armies to punish Western Xia for their betrayal, and in 1225 he attacked with a force of approximately 180,000. After taking Khara-Khoto, the Mongols began a steady advance southward. Asha, commander of the Western Xia troops, could not afford to meet the Mongols as it would involve an exhausting westward march from the capital Yinchuan through 500 kilometers of desert, and so the Mongols steadily advanced from city to city. Enraged by Western Xia's fierce resistance, Genghis engaged the countryside in annihilative warfare and ordered his generals to systematically destroy cities and garrisons as they went. Genghis divided his army and sent general Subutai to take care of the westernmost cities, while the main force under Genghis moved east into the heart of the Western Xia Empire and took Ganzhou, which was spared destruction upon its capture due to it being the hometown of Genghis's commander Chagaan.
In August 1226, Mongol troops approached Wuwei, the second-largest city of the Western Xia empire, which surrendered without resistance in order to escape destruction. In Autumn 1226, Genghis took Liangchow, crossed the Helan Shan desert, and in November lay siege to Lingwu, a mere 30 kilometers from Yinchuan. Here, in the Battle of Yellow River, the Mongols destroyed a force of 300,000 Western Xia that launched a counter-attack against them.
Genghis advanced with three armies into the heart of Jin territory, between the Great Wall and the Yellow River. With the help of Chenyu Liu, one of the top officers who betrayed Jin, as well as the Southern Song, who wanted revenge on Jin, Genghis defeated the Jin forces, devastated northern China, captured numerous cities, and in 1215 besieged, captured and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing (modern-day Beijing).
However, the Jin emperor, Xuan Zong, did not surrender, but moved his capital to Kaifeng.</P> The city fell in the siege of Kaifeng in 1232. Emperor Aizong fled to the town of Caizhou. After this, the Han Chinese general Shi Tianze led troops to pursue Emperor Aizong as he retreated, and destroyed an 80,000-strong Jin army led by Wanyan Chengyi at Pucheng . The Jin dynasty collapsed after the siege of Caizhou in 1234. Eastern Xia, an short-lived kingdom which declared independence from Jin in 1215, was conquered in 1233.
The first Han armies in the Mongol army were those led by defecting individual officers. There were 1,000 Han (Chinese) troops each in 26 units which made up three tumeds arranged by Ogedei Khan on a decimal system. The Han officer Shi Tianze, Han officer Liu Ni and the Khitan officer Xiao Chala, all three of whom defected to the Mongols from the Jin led these three tumeds. Chang Jung, Yen Shi and Chung Jou led three additional tumeds which were created before 1234. The Han defectors were called the "Black Army" (Hei Jun) by the Mongols before 1235. A new infantry based "New Army" (Xin Jun) was created after the Mongols received 95,000 additional Han soldiers through conscription once the 1236 and 1241 censuses were taken after the Jin was crushed. Han cherik forces were used to fight against Li Tan's revolt in 1262. The New Army and Black Army had hereditary officer posts like the Mongol army itself. With the capital city captured Genghis ordered  a mass extermination which kileed 20,000 chinese.
The Mongols valued physicians, engineers,craftsmen and religious clerics and ordered them to be spared from death and brought to them when cities were taken in northern China.
Genghis brought back chinese silk wealth to Mongolia and created his own capital city Karakorum. He created his  medical corps by using chinese physicians teaching the mongols medical care and techniques. Genghis also  wanted his tribes to benefit  with the wealth he brought back from his campaigns.</p><p>his armies learnt the technologies from the chinese military such as the black powder</p>

<h2> Mongol expansion into the middle east and europe</h2>
<p>With all of china part of his empire Genghis decided to create trade routes from china and through Asia. He sent ambassadors to the emperor of persia asking for a trade agreement but a messenger gave Genghis khan the ambassador`s servered head. This act angered Genghis and he sent 20,000 warriors to invade  Persia every town did not surrender was to be burnt on his orders. one million persian men women and children were killed.
After the conquest of Persia he sent an army to advance west as much as they can until they were stopped but they went all the way to Ukraine and Russia. He gave each of his territories to his children</p>

<h2> Genghis khan`s death</h2>
<p> In 1279 he embarked another conquest to western Xia through china but he collapsed during the fall of yinchuan his death remains a mystery but historians believe that his wounds from battle illnesses contributed to battle. His body was returned to Mongolia and buried at an aunknown area everyone who was attended his burial was to be killed.
Marco polo wrote in his journal that he died from an infection from an arrow wound where other sources claim that he was killed  by one of his princess captured from his conquests. some sources claim he died from bubonic plague. Before his death he made his son Ogedei khan as his successor.
Under Ogedei the mongols beseiged and conquered Russia and ukranine successfully. And the mongols expanded into hungary and Poland and Germany. Until Ogedei died and the mongols had to withdraw to vote on a new khan.</p>

<h2> Mongol civil war</h2>
<p> the Mongol civil war was a war of succession fought between Kublai Khan and his younger brother, Ariq Böke, from 1260 to 1264. Möngke Khan died in 1259 with no declared successor, precipitating infighting between members of the Tolui family line for the title of Great Khan that escalated to a civil war. The Toluid Civil War, and the wars that followed it  weakened the authority of the Great Khan over the Mongol Empire and split the empire into autonomous khanates.
Kublai Khan was campaigning against the southern Song in 1260 when he received news that Ariq Böke was challenging him for the succession of the throne. Ariq Böke formed alliances with powerful members of the Mongol nobility to endorse him as a candidate for Great Khan. Most of Möngke's immediate family supported Ariq Böke including the member of Ögedei, Chagatai and Jochi. Kublai withdrew from the Song and mobilized his troops to fight Ariq Böke. In China, Kublai summoned a kurultai at Kaiping, where he was elected Great Khan. This was the first kurultai to proclaim a Great Khan outside the Mongol homeland or Central Asia. Ariq Böke convened his own kurultai in Karakorum that proclaimed him Great Khan a month later, creating two rival claimants for the throne. Hulagu embarked for Mongolia to attend the kurultai, but the Mamluk defeat of the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut forced him to return to the Middle East. Berke capitalized on the Mamluk victory by invading the Ilkhanate, beginning the Berke Hulagu war.
Ariq Böke allied with Berke Khan of the Golden Horde and Alghu of the Chagatai Khanate.</p> Hulagu of the Ilkhanate was the sole ally of Kublai Khan. Berke supported Ariq Böke because he was resentful of Hulagu, who had close ties with Kublai. Hulagu and Berke, however, became occupied with their own war and could not intervene in the  Civil War.
Kublai had access to supplies from the fertile lands of China, while Ariq Böke had to import resources to Karakorum in the semi-arid steppes. Kublai Khan depended on these supplies from China and therefore needed Chinese popular support to win the civil war. Kublai ingratiated himself to his subjects with the help of his Chinese advisers. He presented himself as a sage emperor capable of uniting the Chinese, Korean and his fellow Mongols. While calling out Ariq Böke as a destructive usurper. Kublai promised to reduce taxes, modeled his government institutions to resemble those of the Chinese dynasties, and adopted the era name of Zhongtong, which means "moderate rule". His policies were popular in northern China, but had no impact on his relations with the Southern Song. The Song invaded while Kublai was preoccupied with the civil war, and recovered territory previously lost to the Mongols. Kublai dispatched a diplomat, Hao Jing, to discuss the prospects of a peaceful resolution to the war with the Southern Song. The Song, however, rejected Kublai's overtures and imprisoned Hao for the next decade.
Kublai now controlled three of the four possible supply lines to Karakorum. Kadan, Kublai's Ögedeid ally, defended the territories of the former Western Xia from Ariq Böke and commanded the forces stationed in Gansu. Kublai's troops guarded the area surrounding Yan (modern Beijing). </p>The only supply line still open to Ariq Böke was the Yenisei River valley in the northwest. When Kublai's army advanced towards Karakorum in late 1260, Ariq Böke retreated from Karakorum to a tributary of the Yenisei. The oncoming winter then compelled Kublai and Ariq Böke to encamp their armies and wait for spring.
Ariq Böke's victory against Alghu.In the interim, Kublai acquired more supplies and men. He fortified Yan and the border defenses of northern China. Kadan defeated and executed Alandar, a general sent to secure the vital Central Asian trade routes for Ariq Böke. Lian Xixian, one of Kublai's Confucian advisers, commanded soldiers for the khan in western China. He won a victory against Ariq Böke's ally, Liu Taiping, in northwestern China, seizing food supplies intended for Ariq Böke's army.</p> Lian also drove supporters of Ariq Böke out of the towns of Liangzhou and Ganzhou. In southwestern China, his forces protected Sichuan from Ariq Böke's encroaching troops. Kublai paid Kadan and Lian Xixian handsomely for their military service in gifts and promotions. He rewarded Kadan with 300 packs of silk and 300 taels of silver, and appointed Lian Xixian to the position of Prime Minister of the Right in the Secretariat.
Kublai's victories left Alghu as Ariq Böke's only standing ally. Ariq Böke convinced Alghu to take control of the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia. Chagatai's khan, Qara Hülëgü, had recently died. Alghu fought and killed Abishkha, a rival claimant to the throne endorsed by Kublai as ruler of the khanate. Alghu was one of Ariq Böke's strongest supporters and he appointed him khan of Chagatai. The khanate became an important source of Ariq Böke's provisions. Ariq Böke gave Alghu complete control over tax revenues in the region.
In 1261, Kublai and Ariq Böke engaged in battle at Shimultai. Ariq Böke lost the battle and retreated. He returned to the region ten days later to challenge Kublai's forces near the Khingan Mountains of eastern Mongolia. </p>The troops that Ariq Böke attacked were not personally led by Kublai, and made up only a small portion of Kublai's army. Even so, the battle ended in a stalemate. Meanwhile, most of Mongolia was now under the control of Kublai, threatening Ariq Böke's control of the Yenisei Valley supply line. A weakened Ariq Böke entreated Alghu for help. Alghu refused, and executed the envoys sent by Ariq Böke, who had demanded a share of Alghu's tax revenues.
At this time, a rebellion in China distracted Kublai from the civil war, and he departed for Kaiping instead of further pursuing Ariq Böke. Ariq Böke went to war with Alghu after the threat of an attack by Kublai receded. Alghu defeated Ariq Böke's commander, Khara Bukha, near the Ili River in Xinjiang, but lost his headquarters at Almalikh to Ariq Böke. He withdrew to the oasis cities of the Tarim Basin.</p>
Ariq Böke was now left with few allies, and several of his supporters deserted from his side following his action and atrocities against the Chagatai Khanate.Ürüng Tash, son of Möngke, defected, taking his father's tamga seal from Ariq Böke and giving it to Kublai as a symbol of his loyalty. Alghu then returned to the Ili River to remove Ariq Böke from Xinjiang. Ariq Böke lacked the resources or the allies to defend himself. He travel to Shangdu alone and surrendered to Kublai in 1264, ending the civil war
 The mongol empire was split up </p>

<h2> Mongol invasion of Japan</h2>
<p> With eastern Asia under his control Kublai wanted to expand across the sea in to the pacific and chose to conquer japan but he sent emmiseries to japan asking for their submission to act as a puppet state of Kublai khan. The emperor of japan refused.
So kublai created a yuan invasion force was two massive fleets and composed of 15,000 Mongol, Han Chinese, and Jurchen soldiers, 6,000 to 8,000 Korean troops, and 7,000 Korean sailors. His plan was to invade the Islands closests to japan such as Iki tsushima  and use them as a base to invade the mainland.
Kublai ordered the yuan invasion force to attack tsushima first the jito deputy govenor of tsushima Sukekuni spotted the invasion force and gathered  the samurai garrison roughly around eighty samurai met the 35,000 mongols at komoda beach and completely annihilated the samurai defenders.
The mongols then advanced further inland and pillaged the Island and completely secured it within a week.
The Yuan fleet departed Tsushima on 13 November and attacked Iki Island. The leader Taira no Kagetaka the governor of Iki,spotted the invasion force and gathered the 100 samurai and local population to fight them but they were pushed back to his castle where the mongols surrounded it and killed all the residences within and secured Iki within hours.
With both Islands conquered and minimal casulties kublai gave his permission to invade the mainland japan however as soon as they got to the sea of japan a massive storm destroyed the fleets 200 ships were missing or destroyed 50 yuans who survived and washed up on the japanese shores were executed by the samurai out of the 30,000 army 13,500 did not return to mongolia
The invasion of japan was by far the worst failure of the mongol empire`s military history.</p>

<p> Fearing of a second invasion the shogunate of japan ordered a wall to be constructed all across the japanese coastline
1281 Kublai created an invasion force this time 40,000 soldiers on 900 ships the first plan was to attack Iki again and both northern and southern fleets re group to attack the mainland. When both fleets attacked hakata bay they were facing fanatical resistancefrom the more experienced samurai
who even conducted sabotage operations to the mongol ships destroying them by using fireships. Then on the 15th august a typhoon storm destroyed the mongol fleets a second time a third of the northern fleet was destroyed as was the second half
any survived was killed by the samurai.</p>

<h2>chapter 3: Napoleon bonaparte</h2>
<p>Napoleon was born in a french island of the coast of france named corsica. At aged 16 or above he joined the local military academy and became a junior officer in the artillery.
His rise in power was during the french revoloution when he was a lieutenant in the national guard in paris fighting the royalists. Given his knowledge of artillery combat he defeated the royalist forces marching on the national convention despite him being outnumbered.
This victory gave him  overall command of the french army invading Italy which was considered impossible due to the terrain. But he succeded against impossible odds as the italians were supported by austria.</p>
He then invaded Egypt which again was considered impossible due to the heat but he successfully conquered ehypt despite them being supported by the british royal navy. He failed to hold the region though and was forced to evacuate Egypt.
 Once he returned to france he was hailed as a hero and named himself first consoul. Later on he wanted more power and named himself emperor of the french and renamed the french army as le grande armee (grand army)
 However Britain france and Russia saw napoleon as a threat and formed a third coalition declaring war on him. He wanted to invade great Britain first because they were more closer and more of a threat than the russian and the austrians.
He failed to do so as the royal navy were the most powerful armada in the atlantic ocean at that time. Napoleon forced the austrians to surrender at the battle of Austerlitz whilst the russians retreated.
 Prussia( a state in germany) joined the third coailtion and declared war on napoleon. He wanted portugal to ally with him but they refused and he invaded which prompted a british army under the command of Arthur wellsby duke of wellington to aid the portugese.
he defeated russia but they created a sorched earth policy and he was forced to retreat due to his men dying from lack of supplies diesease and cold.
With this defeat in russia Napoleon lost control in France and was forced into exile.</p>

<h2>Napoleon`s return and battle of waterloo</h2>
<p>Exiled in the tiny island of Elba Napoleon quickly escaped with his 200 old guard infantry the troops sent by the french monarch louis XVIII to arrest napoleon rallied to his cause.
Now with the french army on his side napoleon  entered Paris and was welcomed by the population the monarch had to abdicate again the congress of vienna. (britain prussia sweeden portugal and russia) knew napoleon would wage a second european war and mobilised their armies to fight.
Napoleon knew he had to act fast or risk an invasion from overwheling odds he targeted the british and prussian armies in the netherlands commanded by the duke of wellington and prince Blucher of prussia.
his plan was to defeat bith armies and sue for Peace. In 1805 he crossed the netherlands driving a wedge between the anglo british and prussian armies. one skirmish betwenn the british and the french was by one of his marshals sir michel Nay his second in command who attack Wellington at the battle of Quatre Bras 
Around the same time napoleon with his army engaged Blucher at the battle of Ligny where the french emerged victorious and blucher was injured. </p>
Wellington ordered a retreat through the rain showers and received a promise from Blucher that he would aid Wellington against the french. Napoleon knew that if the british and the prussians can meet they can outnumber him.
So he ordered two of his marshals Étienne Maurice Gérard and Jean-de-Dieu Soult to keep the prussians away from the british at all costs but what napoleon did not know was blucher engaged them at the battle of wavre and emerged victorious and marched to aid wellington.
Wellington held postion in waterloo 25 miles from brussels belgium where he stood and fight. Napoeon had a disadvantage as his artillery batteries were stucked in the mud due to the constant raining and has to wait four hours for it to dry.
He targeted the farmhouse of la haye sainte on wellington`s right flank hoping he draw reserve from the front line where the main line would be weakened.</p>
Wellington knew of this and refused to send any reinforcements. Later on in the battle Wellington knew that napoleon was focusing on his Cavalry and intended to charge the british lines so he tricked the french in beleieving they were retreating only to form square (tactic against cavalary) but the farmhouses of lay haine saint, and hougoumont fell to the french allowing them to move their artillery to the british.
they were eventually pushed back as Blucher and his army flanked their rear. Napoleon then turned to the elite imperial guards but even them could not turn the tide.
News of the imperial guard defeat and prussian encirclement panic broke out and the french retreated only the old guard and a few loyal to napoleon stayed and fought.
In the end the coalition was victorious and napoleon was Exiled to saint helna where he died. Rumours had it that the british somehow poisoned him but is yet to be confirmed.</p>

<h2> chapter 4: World war 1</h2>
<p> World war began in 1914 due to the assassination of the archduke franz ferdinand of austria hungary by a serbian terrorist organisation this then made nations ally and opposed one another triple entente( britain france USA and russia)
and the triple alliance (Germany austria hungary and the ottoman empire).The germans invaded france first in an attempt to defeat them but failed to do so due to the combined might of britain french and belgium forces.
The germans then invaded the russian empire and quickly took a lot of ground as the russian military was outnumbered and poor trained. This led to the bolshevik revoloution which led to the russian royal family executed and the bolsheviks taking power and sued for peace by the germans and were forced to accept their harsh terms. </p>

<h2> The battle of gallipoli</h2>
<p> The battle of gallipoli is is considered to be one of the worst military faliure in the history of the british army. The battle was designed by first lord of the admirality winston churchill and general herbet kitchener to knock out the ottoman empire out of the war.
the plan was to invade the beacheads and to establish a stronghold. The allied side was a combination of british south african indian and ANZAC (australian new zealand and canadian) soldiers. The invasion fleet was spotted by the ottomans and was fired upon by the artillery batteries and were forced to hasten the landing the allies landed on the beaches but faced disease starvation and waves of attacks from the ottomans and the germans
the germans and ottomans pushes the ANZAC back into the sea and the operation for the allies were a huge faliure.</p>

<h2>The schillfen plan</h2>
<p>The schillfen plan was crated by alfred von schliffen head of the german chief of staff. His plan was an offensive stratergy to knock belgium and france out of the war.
He planed to attack belgium first creating a wedge between the belgium and british forces and then do a pivot turn pushing the brish and french to paris. He gave this plan to Kasier Wilhelm who approved of the plan and ordered it to be carried out as soon as possible. He ordered the german forces to link up with the german western forces so he can have enough manpower to carry out the plan. The plan worked perfectly but due the lack of supplies the advance was halted. Their inability to advance beyond the Marne contributed to the use of trench warfare and the formation of the Western Front.

<h2>America in the war</h2>
<p> When war in europe was declared the USA remained neutral as the war as no where near the americas. However a ferry called the RMS lusitania was sunk by a german uboat in the atlantic killing 159 americans.
The german government justified this as they saw the lusitania as a munition ship carrying weapons and supplies for the allies. The congress was debating wether or not to declare war on germany for this action. Public opinion in america agreed to declare war. 
The germans then sent their infamous Zimmermann Telegram. Asking  mexico to become a german ally and invade the USA before americans reach a conclusion to delcare war on germany. The message was intercepted and decoded by british intelligence and sent the message to the USA which persuaded America to join the war with the americans in the war WW1 was quickly over in november 11th 1918.
In 1918 germany was in turmoil the royal navy blockaded the ports (turnip winter) no supplies coming in or out. the politicians in the reichstag lost faith in the kaiser. German naval revoloution in keitel. With this the kaiser abdicated and left Germany.</p>

<h2>The treaty of versailles</h2>
<p> With germany and her allies defeated britain france and the USA leaders met to decide the fate of germany France wanted germany severely punished as the french suffered the most during the war. Britain wanted germany punished but not the same lengths as france the USA did not Germany to be punished as the treaty may create a new war in europe.

The allies created LAMB (land army money and blame) 
Land: Germany is to have overseas colonies in africa  taken by britain and france, the rhineland demilitarised,  no anschluss with austria, Alsace lorraine returned to france. The polish corridor splitting germany and poland giving the polish access to the sea.13% land annexed all together
Army: Germany can have 100,000 men, no conscription, 150,000 sailors, no aircraft, no tanks, six battleships and crusiers (created by great britain as they wanted to be the most powerful naval force in the world and have no competition)
Money: Germany had to pay £6.6 billion due to war damages and 15% raw materials taken by france.
Blame: As they lost the war germany had to accept all blame article 231.
The new german government who the majority was the social democrats led fredrich Ebert who was appointed president of Germany  had to accept these terms</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Rise of the Nazis</h2>
<p>After ww1 and in the 1920s Germany was a weak and divided country politically, ethnically, and socially an event in bavaria called the munich putsch led to the rise of a far right wing party group the NSDAP aka the nazi party
one man who was involved in the munich putsch was Adolf Hitler former german soldier strict right wing politician and antisemetic. He and his SA soldiers marched in the beer hall took the leader of bavaria and mayor hostage he used munich as a base to invade Berlin to take power and even  forced the bavarian leaders to support his plan which they eventually did
however he overestimated his supporters as the german police and army had a skirmish with Hitler and his men which led the putsch to be a faliure Hitler shot and imprisoned.
He was brought to a german court and he expressed his right view political ambitions and the judges were leneint on him giving him a five month prison sentence insead of life as he committed treason.
Hitler became very popular in Germany he wrote mein kampf in prison expressing his views and antisemetism and when he was released he reformed the nazi party he trained the party members to be public speakers, He rejected the treaty of versailles, He used the SA (brownshirts) to fight the german communist party to make them look like the threat
Although the nazi party got famous in germany their voting results was decreased as the SA were seen as thugs forcing people to vote and assault those who refused.</p>

<h2>The great depression</h2>
<p>Even though the nazis were gaining poularity from the public they were not gaining votes until the great depression reached germany. The great depression also known as the 1929 wall street crash was an economic crisis that began in America and spreaded across europe.
with Germany badly affected because the US stopped giving Germany money to rebuild and sent it back to america. Hitler used this to his advantage as he ordered the nazi party to help the people which they did by creating soup kitchens, providing pensions to the elderly. The party`s votes instantly increased becoming the majority in the reichstag.
with the votes for the nazis increasing hitler was in a presidential election race with the German president Paul von hindenburg but lost 14 million to 16 million votes. Hindenburg appointed Hitler as chancellor of Germany. Hitler then banned communism in germany due to the burning of the reichstag due to a communist party member  Marinus van der Lubbe accussed of burning the reichstag which the nazis saw as a comminist coup. Hitler passed protecion of the people of the state banning communism throughout Germany which resulted in 2000 communists imprisoned and the nazis gaining extra votes and the most powerful party . Historians believe that it was the nazis that burned the reichstag and made it look like the communists but is yet to be confirmed.</p>

<h2> Adolf Hitler as dictator</h2>
<p>With Hitler as the most powerful man in Germany with all political parties disbanded and enemies eliminated he wanted to be the president of germany but could not as Paul von hindenburg was the president.
He instead wanted to eliminate threats within his party The infamous SA became a threat as they wanted command of the german armyand outnumbered the army by thre million soldiers which worried Hitler and the army generals in case the brownshirts turn on him so he ordered the SA to be purged (night of the long knives) by the SS which resulted in 20,000 deaths including Ernest Rohm the leader of the SA and Hitler`s personal friend. he used this as an opportunity to purge all enemies in germany even those not in his party Von hindenburg died during the night of the long knives due to a heart attack but is not confirmed if he was killed.
Hitler became president but named himself Fuher he turned Germany in a police state.</p>
He ordered all jews, disabled people, political enemies, gypsies, homosexuals to be in concentration camps. And restarted rearmament and conscription breaking the treaty of versailles he had 550,000 soldiers by 1935. He banned all trade unions. He turned the nazis into a one party organisation
many western politicians were worried but refused to take action as they did not want another war in europe and wanted to use Germany so they can fight the soviet union which the west saw as a threat some politicians thought germany should be strong again. Hitler saw this as a weakness and encouraged himself to build Germany`s military.
One member of his inner circle Hermann Goering (head of the luftwaffe) created the Gestapo german secret police to keep the population loyal to the nazis.</p> Another member joseph Goebells was in charge of the propoganda turning germany into a censorship. A third member of his organisation Reinhard heydrich who created and was in charge of the SD german SS intelligence to gather intelligence about the enemies of the state. Albert speer was in charge of the weapons production and labour for Germany. Heinrich Himmler was in charge of the SS (blackshirts) who was in charge of maintaining national security for Germany.</p>
<p> Hitler as Fuher changed the courts in Germany by making them swear allegiance to him and obey Nazi law. He indoctrinated children in Germany making them antisemetic. He created the Hitler youth training boys to become future German soldiers. He kept his promise to the german people by creating new jobs he invested in the car industry and conscription it is believed that as he created jobs in the car industry which saw the creation of the volkswagen and mercedes today. </p> He created the German labour front (DAF) where people could be paid and even live in the labour front they where used to build hospitals, motorways, schools, roads unemployment decreased by 6 million to 0.5 million. He signed the Rome Berlin axis pact with Benito mussolini il duce (the leader of Italy). And signed an alliance with the empire of Japan.
With Hitler`s military increasing he began to annex other nearby countries. First he joined with austria (anschluss) when austrian Nazis assassinated the chancellor of Austria. Hitler then sent his troops to maintain order but in reality the assassination was to allow the nazis to gain control over Austria. The Austrian population welcomed the nazis.
Then he ordered his troops to march into the Rhineland which the people welcomed the nazis. He took the north of czechslovakia sudetenland by the munich agreement 1938 for its industry and annexed the rest of the nation. </p>

<h2>chapter 6: World war 2 </h2>

<p> With Hitler and the nazis defying the treaty of versailles annexating the rhineland Austria and czechslovakia european nations especially Britain and France were worried that the nazis would declare war.
Winston churchill was warning the prime minister of Britain neville chamerlain of Hitler`s political ideas and that he will start a war but neville did not listen to him. Chamberlain wanted to prevent war by any means necessary he attempted to use diplomatic soloutions to reason with Germany accepting their terms
But by chamerlain accepting the nazi terms encouraged Hitler to pursue his ideas. </p> over 3 million german soldiers he decided to invade Poland first as it was the nearest nation to Germany.
He ordered his generals to create an invasion plan for Poland and on september 1st 1939 the germans invaded Poland with quick success the Polish military were poorly equipted and poor weaponary compared to the german military`s technology being more advanced they used a tactic called Blitzkreieg (lightning war). Where enemy lines would be overwheled and destroyed by aircraft tanks and infantry.Poland fell within a week  Britain and France ordered the germans to with draw their forces but the Germans refused so Britain and France declared war two days later neville chamberlain was asked to resign due to his faliure of not being able to plan on how to supress the nazi threat in the early 1930s.
Just before war broke out Hitler signed an alliance with Joseph stalin leader of the soviet union called the molotov ribbentrop pact where both nations would never declare war on one another and split Poland with each other.
Hitler then invaded Belgium, the netherlands, Norway, Denmark, and France. </p> british army called the BEF (british expeditionary force) roughly 300,000 soldiers was sent to aid France but where quickly overwhelmed by the Germans and facing complete annihilation.
Winston Churchill replaced neville chamberline as  prime minister and he ordered the admirality to gather a fleet of civilian boats to  rescue the army which was called  operation dynamo  which was a complete success.
With mainland Europe under Nazi occupation Hitler ordered his generals to create an invasion plan to invade Britain called operation sea lion.</p>
The plan was quickly abandoned as the only way to invade Britain was to cross the english channel which was guarded by the Royal navy who was the largest and the most powerful naval force in the 20th century. And Hermann Goering`s luftwaffe failed defeat the RAF and  have air superiority in the sky to protect the invasion force.</p>
</p>
<h2>1942  Nazi invasion of USSR</h2>
<p> With the invasion of Great britain abandoned Hitler focused on expanding the reich this time in the east. He set his focus on the soviet union. His generals split the invasion armies into three catagories.
Army group centre to invade Moscow directly before winter, Army group north to invade the Baltic states and Leningrad.</p> Army group south to invade the caucasus oil fields and stalingrad. The invasion also give Hitler a chance to purge communism in europe entirely as one of his promises was to get rid communism so the success of the invasion was very important to Hitler.
Hitler`s staff of generals the OKW (oberkommando der whermacht) was ordered to create an invasion plan but they knew that this invasion would be a colossal faliure as Russia was known for being impossible to invade due to the cold
The OKW moved 3 million german soldiers to the polish soviet border to carry out the invasion but to prevent raising soviet awareness the nazis decared that the invasion force was carrying out military exercises</p>
The many politicians in the USSR was afraid that the germans would invade and pleaded Joseph stalin dictator of the USSR to take action but he refused. The soviet intelligence agency infiltrated the Germany air ministry and had harro schulze boysen as their spy who saw the documents and air recon reports about the USSR
In the 20th century the soviet union had one of the largest spy networks extending all the way to the USA and now has spies inside the heart of the third reich 
Despite intelligence of the invasion plan leaked to stalin he refused to take action. </p>
In the summer on the 22nd of june 1941 Hitler ordered his OKW to give the order to invade the soviet union three million german soldiers aided with spainish, Italian, and Romanian soldiers invaded the USSR with quick results they surprised the soviet forces at the border and quickly took prisoners
By christmas 1942 the germans were 25 miles out of Moscow the key objective however Winter set in and the german soldiers suffered casulties due to frostbite hyperthermia
Stalin released order 237 demanding that no soviet soldier retreats other wise they will be executed for cowardice. Churchill welcomed Stalin as an ally and provided Aid to the russians.</p>
However behind the invasion the oberkommando collaborated with the SS to eliminate jews,communists as back then many Jews lived in Ukraine Belarus moldova and estonia The Einzastgruppen (SS kill squads) murdered millions of them behind the german army`s advance during the invasion.  Due to operation barbarosa the germans were successful in destroying 
 most of the Soviet Air Force on the ground, and advanced deep into Soviet territory using blitzkrieg tactics to destroy entire Soviet armies.</p> The German Army Group North moved towards Leningrad, Army Group South took control of Ukraine, and Army Group Centre advanced towards Moscow. By July 1941, Army Group Centre crossed the Dnieper River, on the path to Moscow. During the soviet retreat they initiated a scortched earth policy taking or destroying any supplies that would help the germans this tactic proved useful in the winter </p>

<h2>Battle of Moscow</h2>
<p>With the German army 25 miles out of Moscow stalin issued an order demaning all of the city`s inhabitants men women and children assist the soviet forces in the defense of the city.</p>The German Strategic Offensive, named Operation Typhoon, called for two pincer offensives, one to the north of Moscow against the Kalinin Front by the 3rd and 4th Panzer Armies, simultaneously severing the Moscow Leningrad railway, and another to the south of Moscow Oblast against the Western Front south of Tula, by the 2nd Panzer Army, while the 4th Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west. </p> The Soviet forces conducted a strategic defence of the Moscow Oblast by constructing three defensive belts, deploying newly raised reserve armies, and bringing troops from the Siberian and Far Eastern Military Districts. As the German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic counter-offensive and smaller-scale offensive operations forced the German armies back to the positions around the cities of Oryol, Vyazma and Vitebsk, and nearly surrounded three German armies. It was a major setback for the Germans, and the end of their belief in a swift German victory over the USSR. As a result of the failed offensive, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch was dismissed as supreme commander of the German Army, with Hitler replacing him in the position. </p> German forces captured Smolensk, an important stronghold on the road to Moscow. At this stage, although Moscow was vulnerable, an offensive against the city would have exposed the German flanks.  Hitler ordered the attack to turn north and south and eliminate Soviet forces at Leningrad and Kiev. This delayed the German advance on Moscow. When that advance resumed on 30 September 1941, German forces had been weakened due to the snow and disease and hunger  the Soviets had raised new forces for the defence of the city</p>
To stiffen the resolve of the Red Army and boost civilian morale, Stalin ordered the traditional military parade on 7 November (Revolution Day) to be staged in Red Square. </p>Soviet troops paraded past the Kremlin and then marched directly to the front. The parade carried a great symbolic significance by demonstrating the continued Soviet resolve, and was frequently invoked as such in the years to come. Despite this brave show, the Red Army's position remained precarious. Although 100,000 additional Soviet soldiers had reinforced Klin and Tula, where renewed German offensives were expected, Soviet defenses remained relatively thin. </p> Nevertheless, Stalin ordered several preemptive counteroffensives against German lines.These were launched despite protests from Zhukov, who pointed out the complete lack of reserves. The Wehrmacht repelled most of these counteroffensives, which squandered Soviet forces that could have been used for Moscow's defense. The only notable success of the offensive occurred west of Moscow near Aleksino, where Soviet tanks inflicted heavy losses on the 4th Army because the Germans still lacked anti-tank weapons capable of damaging the new, well-armoured T-34 tanks.
From 31 October to 13 15 November, the Wehrmacht high command stood down while preparing to launch a second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed considerable nominal strength, its fighting capabilities had thoroughly diminished because of wear and fatigue. While the Germans were aware of the continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east as well as the presence of large reserves, given the tremendous Soviet casualties, they did not expect the Soviets to be able to mount a determined defense. But in comparison to the situation in October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied a much stronger defensive position: a triple defensive ring surrounding the city and some remnants of the Mozhaisk line near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense, with at least two rifle divisions in second echelon positions. </p>Artillery support and sapper teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also many Soviet troops still available in reserve armies behind the front. Finally, Soviet troops and especially officers were now more experienced and better prepared for the offensive.</p>
By 15 November 1941, the ground had finally frozen, solving the mud problem.</p>

<p>The armored Wehrmacht spearheads, consisting of 51 divisions, could now advance, with the goal of encircling Moscow and linking up near the city of Noginsk, east of the capital. To achieve this objective, the German Third and Fourth Panzer Groups needed to concentrate their forces between the Volga Reservoir and Mozhaysk, then proceed past the Soviet 30th Army to Klin and Solnechnogorsk, encircling the capital from the north.</p> In the south, the Second Panzer Army intended to bypass Tula, still held by the Red Army, and advance to Kashira and Kolomna, linking up with the northern pincer at Noginsk. The German 4th Field Army in the centre were ordered  to pin down the troops of the eastern front 
On 15 November 1941, German tank armies began their offensive towards Klin, where no Soviet reserves were available because of Stalin's wish to attempt a counteroffensive at Volokolamsk, which had forced the relocation of all available reserve forces further south. Initial German attacks split the front in two, separating the 16th Army from the 30th. Several days of intense combat followed. Zhukov recalled in his memoirs that "The enemy, ignoring the casualties, was making frontal assaults, willing to get to Moscow by any means necessary. </p> The Wehrmacht's efforts, the multi-layered defense reduced Soviet casualties as the Soviet 16th Army slowly retreated and constantly harassed the German divisions which were trying to make their way through the fortifications.</p>
On 26 November 1941, the German 2nd Panzer Army under General Heinz Guderian began advancing towards Kashira, which was a strategic stronghold that lay 120 kilometres southwest of Moscow and 80 kilometres northeast of Tula. Kashira was of paramount importance, considering that it was the headquarters of the Soviet Western Front, one of the three main groups of resistance against the Nazi storm. The Germans were capable of seizing Venev and pushing towards storming formidably towards Kashira. Should Kashira fall, the road to Moscow would be open for the 2nd Panzer Group. In an attempt to halt the onslaught of the 2nd Panzer Group, the STAVKA High Command hurled Major General Pavel Belov's 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, General Andrei Getman's 112th Tank Division, an armoured brigade and a battalion of BM-13 Katyusha rocket launchers along with support from the air force against the armoured beast of the Wehrmacht. The cavalrymen of the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, which was primarily armed with the SVT-41 semi-automatic battle rifle and Cossack shashkas, as well as the mechanized troops possessing T34 M1940 and KV-1 tanks, battled relentlessly against Heinz Guderian's 2nd Panzer Group. After much vicious fighting, the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps was able to repel the armoured forces of Guderian and subsequently drove them back by 40 kilometres to the town of Mordves. </p> This became the end of one of the greatest German generals, Heinz Guderian's carrier who is credited with invented blitzkrieg and conquering most of Europe. By the culminating point of the battle, considered the best tank army, has been stopped and defeated by the Soviet cavalry led by Pavel Belov with his much lower number of supporting tanks and aircraft. </p>
The Germans were driven back in early December, securing the southern approach to the city. </p>

<p>Tula itself held, protected by fortifications and determined defenders mostly from the 50th army, made of both soldiers and civilians. In the south, the Wehrmacht never got close to the capital. The first stroke of the Western-Front's counter-offensive on the outskirts of Moscow fell upon Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army.
Because of the resistance on both the northern and southern sides of Moscow, on 1 December the Wehrmacht attempted a direct offensive from the west along the Minsk-Moscow highway near the city of Naro-Fominsk. </p>This offensive had limited tank support and was directed against extensive Soviet defenses. After meeting determined resistance from the Soviet 1st Guards Motorized Rifle Division and flank counterattacks staged by the 33rd Army, the German offensive stalled and was driven back four days later in the ensuing Soviet counteroffensive. On the same day, the French-manned 638th Infantry Regiment, the only foreign formation of the Wehrmacht that took part in the advance on Moscow, went into action near the village of Diutkovo. On 2 December, a reconnaissance battalion came to the town of Khimki—some 30 km (19 mi) away from the Kremlin in central Moscow reaching its bridge over the Moscow-Volga Canal as well as its railway station. This marked the closest approach of German forces to Moscow.
On 30 November, von Bock claimed in a report to Berlin that the temperature was -45 °C -49 °F. </p>  The germans were  freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. The same cold weather hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared. </p>
The Axis offensive on Moscow stopped. Heinz Guderian reported that the germans have underestimated the soviet`s  strengthand resiliance as well as the climate. Although the Wehrmacht's offensive had been stopped, German intelligence estimated that Soviet forces had no more reserves left and thus would be unable to stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East.</p> The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin. Even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men  only slightly outnumbering the Wehrmacht. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.</p>
On 5 December 1941, the counteroffensive for "removing the immediate threat to Moscow" started on the Kalinin Front. </p>

<p>The South-Western Front and Western Fronts began their offensives the next day. After several days of little progress, Soviet armies retook Solnechnogorsk on 12 December and Klin on 15 December. Guderian's army "beat a hasty retreat towards Venev" and then Sukhinichi. "The threat overhanging Tula was removed.
On 8 December, Hitler had signed his directive No.39, ordering the Wehrmacht to assume a defensive stance on the whole front.</p> German troops were unable to organize a solid defense at their initial locations and were forced to pull back to consolidate their lines. Guderian wrote that discussions with Hans Schmidt and Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen took place the same day, and both commanders agreed the current front line could not be held Due to the casulties and soviet brutal attack.</p> On 14 December, Franz Halder and Günther von Kluge finally gave permission for a limited withdrawal to the west of the Oka river, without Hitler's approval. On 20 December, during a meeting with German senior officers, Hitler cancelled the withdrawal and ordered his soldiers to defend every patch of ground,  Guderian protested, pointing out that losses from cold were actually greater than combat losses and that winter equipment was held by traffic ties in Poland. Nevertheless, Hitler insisted on defending the existing lines, and Guderian was dismissed by 25 December, along with generals Hoepner and Strauss, commanders of the 4th Panzer and 9th Army, respectively. Fedor von Bock was also dismissed, officially for "medical reasons". Walther von Brauchitsch, Hitler's commander-in-chief, had been removed even earlier, on 19 December.</p>
Meanwhile, the Soviet offensive continued in the north. </p>

<p>The offensive liberated Kalinin and the Soviets reached Klin on 7 December, overrunning the headquarters of the LVI Panzer Corps outside the city. As the Kalinin Front drove west, a bulge developed around Klin. The Soviet front commander, General Ivan Konev, attempted to envelop any German forces remaining. Zhukov diverted more forces to the southern end of the bulge, to help Konev trap the Third Panzer Army. The Germans pulled their forces out in time. Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made to outflank Army Group Centre's northern forces, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until March 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving Tula on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the German XXXV Corps, protecting Guderian's Second Panzer Army's southern flank.
The Luftwaffe was paralysed in the second half of December.</p>The weather, recorded as -42 °C -44 °F, was a meteorological record. Luftwaffe had virtually vanished from the skies over Moscow, while the Red Air Force, operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger. </p> On 4 January, the skies cleared. The Luftwaffe was quickly reinforced, as Hitler hoped it would save the situation. The Kampfgruppen (Bomber Groups) II./KG 4 and II./KG 30 arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four Transportgruppen (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 Junkers Ju 52 transports were deployed from Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. </p> It was a last minute effort and it worked. The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets' best efforts, the Luftwaffe had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Centre. Between 17 and 22 December the Luftwaffe destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army's pursuit of the German Army.</p>
In the centre, Soviet progress was much slower. Soviet troops liberated Naro-Fominsk only on 26 December, Kaluga on 28 December, and Maloyaroslavets on 2 January, after ten days of violent action. </p> Soviet reserves ran low, and the offensive halted on 7 January 1942, after having pushed the exhausted and freezing German armies back 100-250 km  from Moscow. </p>Stalin continued to order more offensives in order to trap and destroy Army Group Centre in front of Moscow, but the Red Army was exhausted and overstretched and they failed. The battle of Moscow was a success for the soviet forces and pushed them to the polish border and began a massive counter attack.</p>

<h2>Enigma</h2>
<p> when war in europe began the nazis used a device called Enigma. An electric device which allowed the nazi high command SS and abwehr (german military intelligence) to communicate with one another using encrypted messages.
Polish intelligence captured one of the enigma machines and smuggled this to the british before Poland fell to the Nazis. British intelligence MI5 knew the threat of enigma and knew they had to decipher it if they could stand a chance against the nazis.
So MI5 recruited Mathematicians and professors who studied cryptanalysis from oxford and cambridge one of these mathmaticians were Alan Turing the inventor of computers.</p>
Turing and his team at bletchley park hut 18  eventually cracked Enigma by creating an electric machine called the bombe to help decipher the german messages
To avoid german suspicion was enigma was deciphered by the British Turing was forced to let countless people die otherwise the nazis become extremely suspicious and would change the enigma settings
Turing was responsible for using Enigma to fool the nazis. He tricked the nazis in 1944 sending messages that the allies would invade from Italy. Historians predict that Turing decrypting Enigma shortened WW2 by two years saving millions of lives.
One member of Turing`s team was John caincross who was a soviet spy and was relaying information to the soviets. By the end of WW2 caincross was arrested for treason. To recognise Turing`s service a film called the imitation game starring benedict cumberbatch and Kiera knightly was created</p>

<h2>Pearl harbour</h2>
<p>When war broke out in europe the president of the USA franklin roosevelt declared that the US was remain neutral.However, tensions were rising in the pacific with the empire of Japan as they kept expanding all across the pacific the US placed oil embargos on the japanese but only increased Tensions. The japanese decided to destroy US presence in the pacific by targeting their fleet at Pearl harbour Hawaii.
The japanese sent spies to pearl harbour to sent recon reports to Tokyo so they could pln an attack the decision was made that the attack should happen by air which meant bombers
The american high command was afraid of an attack but did not know where the attack would be until the japanese launched an air raid on Pearl harbour crippling the US naval forces 
roosevelt declared war the next day and Hitler declared war on the US. roosevelt signed an executive order demanding all japanese civilians in the US be detained as they could support the japanese military.
The japanese began its expansion in Asia and in the pacific. Before the war they invaded Korea and china in 1935 and continued their invasion of china eventually reaching Bejing. They were successful in defeating the British in china, malyasia and singapore.
The OSS (Office of strategic services) American military intelligence discovered that the Japansese were listening in on their radio communications so the OSS recruited native indians to confuse the Japansese.</p>

<h2> War in Africa</h2>
<p> With the fall of Poland and operation barbarossa the war reached the african continent when the British in africa was defeating the italian forces in africa. The Italian armed forces during the war was completely weak and had poor leadership and training unlike the much bigger british army. Mussolini wanted an Italian empire in the mediterrean like the Roman empire and he wanted to look like a strong leader but in reality he was very weak. Hitler allied regardless with him because Italy provided Germany food and he wanted to keep his alliance and trade deal
The italian dictator Benito mussolini asked Hitler for aid. He sent Erwin Rommel and his Africa korps. 
Erwin Johannes eugen Rommel was one of the best general in the regime and a perfect tactician he pushed the british from Egypt all the way to the middle east Iraq despite his supplies running low . He is especially known for the battle of Tobruk. With the british losing the war in Africa an officer called David stirling came forward with an idea to create a commando unit designed to go behind German lines and wreak havoc on their supply lines and bases. British command gave Stirling permission to create the commando unit. This was called the special air services (SAS). Despite the first operations were a failure the SAS were highly successful in destroying Rommel`s supplies and airbases crippling his air superiority which gave the British a chance to push the Germans back.
Churchill put Bernard montgomerty in charge of the british forces in africa and he defeated Rommel at the battle of El alemein and pushed the nazis back with the aid of American troops and captured what was left of the Afrika korps.</p>        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yeHo-3Klmx0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2>invasion of Italy</h2>
<p>With the axis forces defeated in Africa and america in the war the three leaders churchill stalin and roosevelt met in Tehran to discuss an allied invasion of Europe and the decision was made for the british and americans to invade sicily and then mainland Italy then europe  as the soviet forced was pushing back the germans in eastern europe The plan would allow tha allies to knock Italy out of the war leaving the Germans on their own in europe 
The American high command under General esienhower created an invasion plan of Italy. Whereas british intelligence created a plan to deceive the nazis called operation mincemeat.
The operation was a plan created by two british naval officers ewan montague and charles Cholmondeley to trick the nazis in believing that the allies would invade Greece not Italy in order to disguise the invasion of sicily.
Montagu had the idea of having a corpse dressed as a British officer and have the royal navy dump the body at sea so it could wash ashore in Spain, the corpse was carrying faked papers created by montague and his team revealing plans for invasion of Greece. Spanish law officials found the corpse and the papers to German agents. (despite spain not an axis ally they were sympathetic to the nazis) Montagu manufactured a false identity, "William Martin" for the body of Glyndwr Michael to have in his pockets: military ID, theatre ticket stubs, love letters and a photo of his fiancée, bills from a tailor and jeweller.
The german agents had the documents brought to abwehr HQ in Berlin and the oberkommando made the decision to divert the Germans to Greece. The allies then launched the invasion operation Husky  where the casulties were only limited and the allies were fighting minimal Italian and German forces
mussolini wanted to enter peace talks with the allies but a revoloution in Rome prevented him to do so Itaian partisans executd him and his family The allies pushed the germans to the German Italian border. but the allies were halted by the Germans as they created a defense line called the Siegfried line which took the allies a year to break through.</p>

<h2>operation overlord D-DAY</h2>
<p> The british and Americans created a plan for a second allied front this time to invade mainland France. The SOE (special oerations executive british special forces) were smuggled in to france where they would train the french resistance in espionage, guerilla warfare, and sabotage. </p> resistance relayed information to the allies about the whermacht deployments troop movement, and the atlantic wall. When France capitulated in 1939 Hitler ordered a defense line to be constructed from Norway all the way to spain called the atlantic wall . The work required labour and the german Army gathered many french citizens to build the wall many refused and purposefully worked slow.</p>
The oberkommando met with high ranking whermacht members outside of paris to discuss the defense. two  of the members of Erwin rommel who was summoned from  Africa to Berlin before the africa corps was defeated and Gerd von Rundstedt. Both commanders were in a debate about the defense. Von Rundstedt suggested that the allies should be defeated when they land ashore whereas, Rommel suggested they should be destroyed at sea before they reach the beaches. Then they wanted to decide when to move the panzer divisions von Rundstedt wanted the panzers at the beachheads but Rommel from his days in africa knew that the panzers will be destroyed by aircraft and naval bombardments when they reach the beaches. Hiter intervened with both men and said the panzers will be under his command only and he will give the order to use them.
The allied commanders made a decision that the invasion should take place at Normandy beach at five strategic locations Juno,sword, omaha, Gold and Utah.</p>The plan was to establish a stronghold on all five beaches and push the germans back. Weeks before the invasion the SAS were parachuted into france to sabotage the German`s defenses.</p>
Then on the 6th june 1944 a combined force of british, american, canadian indian, south african australian and new zealand troops invaded France The royal navy bombarded the beacheads but caused little damage then when the invasion forces reached their targets they were under heavy fire from the Germans on the atlantic wall and bunkers firing down on the allied troops.Despite not accomplishing their objectives the allies were successful in establishing strongholds on all the beaches After securing territory in the Cotentin Peninsula south as far as Saint-Lô.</p> the U.S. First Army launched Operation Cobra on 25 July and advanced further south to Avranches by 1 August. The British launched Operation Bluecoat on 30 July to secure Vire and the high ground of Mont Pinçon. Lieutenant General Patton's U.S. Third Army, activated on 1 August, quickly took most of Brittany and territory as far south as the Loire.</p> while the First Army maintained pressure eastward toward Le Mans to protect their flank. By 3 August, Patton and the Third Army were able to leave a small force in Brittany and drive eastward towards the main concentration of German forces south of Caen.on 4 August Hitler ordered a counter-offensive (Operation Lüttich) from Vire towards Avranches. in an attempt to drive the allies in the sea
While  the II Canadian Corps pushed south from Caen toward Falaise in Operation Totalize on 8 August,</p> Bradley and Montgomery realised that there was an opportunity for the bulk of the German forces to be trapped at Falaise. The Third Army continued the encirclement from the south, reaching Alençon on 11 August. Although Hitler continued to insist until 14 August that his forces should counter-attack, Kluge and his officers began planning a retreat eastward.The German forces were severely hampered by Hitler's insistence on making all major decisions himself, which left his forces without orders for periods as long as 24 hours while information was sent back and forth to the Führer's residence at Obersalzberg in Bavaria. </p>On the evening of 12 August, Patton asked Bradley if his forces should continue northward to close the gap and encircle the German forces. Bradley refused because Montgomery had already assigned the First Canadian Army to take the territory from the north. The Canadians met heavy resistance and captured Falaise on 16 August. </p>The gap was closed on 21 August, trapping 50,000 German troops but more than a third of the German 7th Army and the remnants of nine of the eleven Panzer divisions had escaped to the east. Montgomery's decision-making regarding the Falaise Gap was criticised at the time by American commanders, especially Patton, although Bradley was more sympathetic and believed Patton would not have been able to close the gap. The issue has been the subject of much discussion among historians, criticism being levelled at American, British and Canadian forces. Hitler relieved Kluge of his command of the  Western front on 15 August and replaced him with Field Marshal Walter Model.
Despite havy allied casulties they were successful in taking all five beaches and citizens in Paris began an uprising against the nazis and the allies soon took paris and liberated France.</p>

<h2>Anti nazi resistance </h2>
Despite Hitler`s regime was full of antisemetic aryan nazis loyal him to the death there were a few resistance movements in Germany  who resisted his lunacy during the war.</p>
1) <b>The edwelweiss pirates:</b>Evaded german conscription and hitler youth they attacked beated up any nazi officials and hitler youth they saw in 1944 they assassinated the head of the cologne gestapo and were executed</p>
2)<b> white rose group</b> created by sophie and hans scholl who wanted to raise public awareness of the nazi holocause during the war. On January 1943 they printed leaflets released it all over munich university before their escape a janitor reported them to the Gestapo both bere arrested in court the judges who swore an path of loyalty to hitler sentenced them the death penalty both were executed by gullotine.</p>
3) <b> swing kids</b> played american jazz music which was forbidden in nazi territory the members were arrested by the gestapo and put in concentration camps</p>
4) <b>operation valkeriye</b> An whermacht conspiracy by high ranking officers who realized that the allies and soviets would destroy Germany they plotted to kill Hitler and his inner circle disarm the SS purge the SD and form a government of their own in Berlin and sue for peace to the allies. One member colonel claus von staffenburg joined the resistance after he lost faith in the reich after his experiences in Africa and russia and the allies turning the tide in the war. He became the chief of staff for the reserve army. </p>He and the conspirators decided to kill hitler at the wolf`s lair and mobilise the reserve army for their plans. On 20th july 1944 von staffenburg was called to the wolf lair meeting and placed a explosive device in the the meeting room and left before it exploded. Hitler survived due to an wooded oak table leg shielding him from the blast Von staffenburg went to Berlin to carry out the second phase of the plan to overthrow SS and nazi leaders. </p> Goebells broadcasted across germany that Hitler was alive and then the army loyal to hitler got in a skirmish with von staffenburg and the conspirators and captured them. Another conspirator fredrick fromm ordered von staffenburg, Ludwig beck werner von haeften and friedrich olbricht to be shot possibly to cover up his involvememt he was executed for failing to stop the conspiracy. Because of the conspiracy Hilter loss faith in the army generals and became paranoid that they would turn against them. </p>Thousands of people in germany were executed for their involvement. One conspirator in interrogation revealed Erwin Rommel as a conspirator he was arrested by two whermacht generals but instead of executing him they gave him a cyanide pill and promised they would protect his name and reputation and family. winston churhill praised him for rising against Hilter.</p>
5) <b>church opposition</b> martin niemoller formed the confessional church in response to Hitler`s reich church  many priests including niemoller were arrested.

<H2> Fall of berlin end of WW2</H2>
<p> With soviet and allied forces advancing through Germany. The russians encircled Berlin and began street to street fighting. Members of his inner circle decide to escape or defect to the allies Heinrich himmler decide to surrender to the british but they captured him. Albert speer wanted to cover up his involvememt of the holocause but the US captured him and hermann goering. Joseph Goebells and his wife and 10 children committed suicide. Hilter and his wife eva braum committed suicide as well then three days later admiral Karl donitz became the president of germany and annouced its surrender. The allies began a denazification in germany and split it up in two countries western germany owned by the allies and eastern germany owned by the soviets. After the nazi surrender on may the third the americans atomed bombed hiroshima and nagasaki japan. Which led to the japanese surrender. Historians believe Tokyo was the target for the nuclear bomb but the pilot was running low on fuel
Roosevelt died a few weeks before ww2 was finished and his vice president patrick trueman was sworn in as president. He dissolved the league of nation and created NATO (north atlantic traty organisation)  a military alliance in europe with britain france and USA as the founded nations. Both sides wanted to use the nazi scientists for their own technological advances and promised not to charge them for war crimes most defected to the allies </p>

<h2> nazi weapons and technology</h2>
<p> The nazis created the most dangerous weapons in the 20th century but was not enough for them to win the war. The allies could not compete with them.
One of their weapons was the tiger tank which was the strongest tank the german army had it was completely immune to any attack and its artillery gun could penetrate any allied armour. it costed germany millions to mass produce these tanks.
Another weapon was the V2 missiles. The german scientist created a missile that could destroy an entire city at once. Hitler used these missiles on london during the war and when france was liberated most of the missiles were captured or destroyed and he could not use them on london or the allied armies.
There has been rumours that by 1944 Hilter`s scientists was on the verge of creating a nuclear bomb when the allies and soviets were advancing to berlin they found many labs that contained the resources to build the nuclear weapons. Historians predict if the war lasted to 1946 hitler would have a nuclear weapon</p>
